<h2>Protect(), Unprotect(), and Restore()</h2>

<p>
  By design, WordPress stores information on the current post and page query in what are known as <strong>global variables</strong>.
  In order for ComicPress to be able to work properly, it needs to be able to work with posts that are not part of the current page's Loop.
  The best example is on the Home page of a standard webbomic, where the latest comic is pulled in above the list of current blog posts.
  Programmtically, it can be tricky to keep track of and manage these variables. ComicPress can handle all of this for you using the Protect(),
  Unprotect(), and Restore() functions.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if you want to display the latest comic at the top of your home page, above your blog posts, you would use Protect() and Restore() like this:
</p>

<pre>
	get_header();


</pre>

<p>
  These are also available as action hooks, to keep your theme safe when ComicPress Core is deactivated:
</p>

<pre>

</pre>

<h2>R() and RT()</h2>

<p>R() and RT() find posts that are in relation to the current or provided post.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>child_of</strong>: The given category plus any children.</li>
</ul>
