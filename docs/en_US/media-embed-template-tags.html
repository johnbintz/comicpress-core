<h1>Media Embedding Template Tags</h1>

<p>
	<em>ComicPress Core</em> provides a handful of template tags to access the media attached to each post.
</p>

<h2>M()</h2>

<p>
	<code>M()</code> retrieves the attachment info from the current post.
	Attachment info is returned as an array of IDs that the various backends can identify and work with:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-php">
// we're in a Loop, so grab the current post's media and embed it
foreach (M() as $image) { echo EM($image); }

// we have a post and want its media
$first_post = R('first');
foreach (M($first_post) as $image) { echo EM($image); }

var_dump(M());
</pre>
